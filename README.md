# hackathon-smart-collection
This project my team and I built in order to compete with other team in Mission Hackathon 3.0. 
We built the smart collection using AI (tensorflow) to classify the trashes such as: compost, recycle, landfill, and e-waste.
In the front-end, my team used javascript and other framework such as: react native, react,...
In back-end I used mainly java store and fetch data. I also created Restful API and websocket in order
to build real-time application.
